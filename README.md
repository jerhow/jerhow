- Hi, I’m Jerry 👋
- I’m interested in experimental art and music, code, blockchain, interesting projects, authentic people, and the subtle, uncanny horror of conversational AI 👀
- I enjoy Ruby, Go, Clojure, C#, PHP, and ASM on retro hardware (specifically 6502 and Z80). I still like relational databases.
