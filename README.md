- Based in Northern Colorado
- Interested in experimental art and music, interesting technical projects, authentic people, and the subtle, uncanny horror of artificial intelligence
- I enjoy Ruby, Go, Clojure, C#, PHP, and ASM on retro hardware (mainly 6502 and Z80). I still like relational databases. Libraries > frameworks.
- Not a fan of unnecessary abstractions. ORMs are a category of mental illness.
