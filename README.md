- Based in Northern Colorado
- Interested in experimental art and music, interesting technical projects, authentic people, and the subtle, uncanny horror of artificial intelligence 🤖
- I enjoy C#, Ruby, Go, Clojure, PHP, and ASM on retro hardware (mainly 6502 and Z80). I've been using Azure a lot recently, though 'enjoy' might be too strong a word for that. I still like relational databases. Libraries > frameworks.
